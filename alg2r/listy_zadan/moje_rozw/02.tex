\subsection*{EXERCISE 4.}
{\color{pink}Assume that $K$ is a finite field, characteristic $p$.

(a) Prove that every irreducible polynomial $f\in K[x]$ divides the polynomial $w_n(x)=x^n-1$ for some $n$ not divisible by $p$. (hint: prove that the splitting field of $f$ is finite.)}

Let $f$ be an irreducible polynomial $f\in K[x]$ and $n=deg(f)>0$ and let $a_1,...,a_r\in L\supseteq K$ be its roots, where $L$ is the splitting field of $f$ over $K$. Because $K$ is finite, i can say that $|K|=q$.

For my convenience, I will consider $g=b_n^{-1}f$, where $b_n$ is the leading coefficient in $f$. So now $g$ is a monic polynomial and considering the splitting field of $f$ is the same as considering the splitting field of $g$ - I just multiplied a polynomial by a nonzero constant.

\acc{Lemaczysko:} \emph{An irreducible polynomial $g\in K[X]$ is the minimal polynomial for some root $a$, $f(a)=0$}

As $K$ is a field, the ring $K[X]$ is an euclidean domain. Let us suppose that $h\in K[X]$ is the minimal polynomial of $a$ in $K$ such that $deg(h)<deg(g)$. We have that there exists $p,r\in K[X]$ such that
$$f=hp+r$$
but notice that $f(a)=0$ and $h(a)=0$, so $r=0$ and we would have $f=hp$ but $f$ was irreducible.
\medskip

\acc{Lemat:}\emph{ The splitting field of $g$ (equivalently, of $f$) is finite.}

We will construct the splitting field of $K$ as such:
$$L_1=K(a_1)$$
$$L_2=L_1(a_2)$$
$$L_i=L_{i-1}(a_i)$$
and then $L=L_r$.

1. $[L_1:K] = n$. The ideal
$$I(a_1/K)=\{w\in K[X]\;:\;w(a_1)=0\}=(g)$$
because $g$ is irreducible. We showed that $g$ is minimal in \hyperref[lemaczysko]{\acc{Lemaczysko}} and so from Remark 4.5. (\hyperref[remark:4:5]{below}) we have that $[L_1:K]=deg(g)=n$.

2. $[L_{i+1}:L_i] = n$. Once again, $g$ is irreducible over $L_{i}$ (because not all roots of $g$ are in $L_i$)
$$I(a_{i+1}/K)=\{w\in K[X]\subseteq L_i[X]\;:\;w(a_{i+1})=0\}=(g)$$
and it follows from Remark 4.5. (\hyperref[remark:4:5]{once again}) that $[L_{i+1},L_i]=deg(g)=n$.
\medskip

Now, using Fact 4.6. (\hyperref[fact:4:6]{even belower}) We have that
\begin{align*}
    [L:K]&=[L_r:L_{r-1}][L_{r-1}:L_{r-2}]=...=\prod\limits_{i=1}^r[L_i:L_{i-1}]=n^r<\infty.
\end{align*}

Let $m=p^k+1$ such that $m>[L:K]$. It is clear that $p\nmid m$. Now, consider the polynomial
$$w_m(x)=x^m-1=(x-1)\underbrace{(x^{m-1}+x^{m-2}+...+x+1)}_{v_m(x)}$$
and we will show that $(x-a_i)|v_m$ for every $i=1,...,r$.

{\color{orange}Remark 4.5.}
\emph{ Suppose that $I(a/K)=(f)$ and $f$ is monic. Then:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $f$ is the minimal monic polynomial such that $f(a)=0$
    \item $deg(f)=[K(a):K]$, thus the degree of the minimal polynomial is equal to the dimension of the linear space $K(a)$ over $K$.
\end{enumerate}}
