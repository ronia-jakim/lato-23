\begin{problem}[8]{}
  Let $S, T$ be multiplicatively closed subsets of $A$, such that $S\subseteq T$. Let $\phi:S^{-1}A\to T^{-1}A$ be the homomorphism which maps each $\frac{a}{s}\in S^{-1}A$ to $\frac{a}{s}$ considered as a member of $T^{-1}A$. Show that the following statements are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\phi$ is bijective
    \item $(\forall\;t\in T)\;\frac{t}{1}$ is a unit in $S^{-1}A$
    \item $(\forall\;t\in T)(\exists\;x\in A)\;xt\in S$
    \item Every prime ideal which meets $T$ also meets $S$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

$1\implies 2$ Obvious?

%Take any $t\in T$. We know that because $\phi$ is bijective, there exists a unique $\phi(\frac{t}{1})$ and also $\phi(\frac{1}{t})$. We also know that $\frac{t}{1}\cdot\frac{1}{t}=\frac{t}{t}=\frac{1}{1}=1$ so $\phi(\frac{t}{1}\cdot\frac{1}{t})=1$.

$2\implies 3$ Take any $t\in T$. We know that $\frac{t}{1}$ is a unit in both $T^{-1}A$ and $S^{-1}A$. Hence, there exists $\frac{a}{s}$ such that $\frac{t}{1}\cdot\frac{a}{s}=\frac{at}{s}=1$ which implies that $at\in S$

$3\implies 4$
